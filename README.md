Object-Detection-in-Jetson-Nano NVIDIA Jetson Nano jetson



The NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit is an AI computer for makers, learners, and developers that brings the power of modern artificial intelligence to a low-power, easy-to-use platform. Get started quickly with out-of-the-box support for many popular peripherals, add-ons, and ready-to-use projects.

We are grateful to NVIDIA and SRM Institute of Science and Technology for giving us the opportunity to work on this project.

Setting up NVIDIA Jetson Nano

For setting up the kit for the first time we reffered to the tutorial made by the NVIDIA Developer - Video Link

Other than the kit we have connected some other required objects-

IMX-219-77 Camera Module Ethernet connection External Monitor/Display 32GB MicroSD Card HDMI Cable Power Adapter with Supply image Setting up YOLO-Object Detection We will be installing Darknet using the Jetson's terminal from AlexeyAB/darknet. git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git cd darknet Enable GPU and OpenCV support by editing the Makefile and also compile the makefile- sudo nano Makefile Set the following values to enable GPU and OpenCV support-

GPU=1

CUDNN=1

OPENCV=1

make To run object detection with Darknet, we need a model config and model weights(in the cfg directory). wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights We are done with installation part and we need to run the camera module to see the predictions in real time- detectnet-camera.py
