# Object-Detection-in-Jetson-Nano NVIDIA Jetson Nano jetson



The NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit is an AI computer for makers, learners, and developers that brings the power of modern artificial intelligence to a low-power, easy-to-use platform. Get started quickly with out-of-the-box support for many popular peripherals, add-ons, and ready-to-use projects.

We are grateful to NVIDIA and SRM Institute of Science and Technology for giving us the opportunity to work on this project.

# Setting up NVIDIA Jetson Nano

For setting up the kit for the first time we reffered to the tutorial made by the NVIDIA Developer - Video Link

Other than the kit we have connected some other required objects-

IMX-219-77 Camera Module Ethernet connection External Monitor/Display 32GB MicroSD Card HDMI Cable Power Adapter with Supply image Setting up YOLO-Object Detection We will be installing Darknet using the Jetson's terminal from AlexeyAB/darknet. git clone https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet.git cd darknet Enable GPU and OpenCV support by editing the Makefile and also compile the makefile- sudo nano Makefile Set the following values to enable GPU and OpenCV support-

GPU=1

CUDNN=1

OPENCV=1

make To run object detection with Darknet, we need a model config and model weights(in the cfg directory). wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights We are done with installation part and we need to run the camera module to see the predictions in real time- detectnet-camera.py
